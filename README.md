# Advent of Code 2025

This year, I am taking on the Advent of Code challenge by solving each day's puzzle in a different programming language.

Since there are only 12 days in this years AOC, each day i am going to use a different language, as follows:

## Daily Language Plan

| Day | Language   |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | TypeScript |
| 2   | Python     |
| 3   | Go         |
| 5   | Java       |
| 6   | C#         |
| 8   | Ruby       |
| 7   | Bash       |
| 9   | Swift      |
| 10  | Haskell    |
| 11  | C++        |
| 12  | Zig        |
| 4   | Rust       |

Each day's solution is in its respective folder, and the README in each folder will indicate the language used and any setup instructions.
